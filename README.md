### Natural Language Processing

[Fake News Detector & Sentiment Analysis](/fake_news_detector.html)<br>
<br>
I used NLP techniques and trained a classification model to predict fake news articles. I've also performed sentiment analysis to determine news sentiment.<br>

### Machine Learning & Exploratory Data Analysis 

[Investment prediction](/investment_prediction.html)

Full end-to-end data science process was applied to predict investment outcomes using Russell 3000 Index financial data. I've performed exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, hypothesis testing, model selection and evaluation, feature selection and model optimisation.<br>

### Data Wrangling & Webscraping 

[Salary prediction](//notebooks/salary/part_3_predictive_modelling.html)<br>
<br>
I've extracted salary data from seek.com.au through web-scraping techniques and trained a classification model to predict data scientist salary.<br>

### Regression problem 

[Real estate prediction](/regression.html)<br>
<br>
I've built regression model to predict real estate property prices. Identified top property features that will add the most value to property prices.<br>
