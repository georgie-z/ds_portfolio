[AI Web Navigator](https://github.com/georgie-z/web_voyager_project/blob/main/README.md)<br>
<br>

I built an AI-driven web page navigator using Bunnings website as an example. The core functionality requires the AI to autonomously search for a product, add it to the cart, and navigate to the checkout review page while handling minor UI variations. This project is based on WebVoyager by He, et. al., a vision-enabled web-browsing agent capable of controlling the mouse and keyboard. The agent works by viewing annotated browser screenshots for each turn, then choosing the next step to take. The agent architecture is a basic reasoning and action (ReAct) loop.

### Natural Language Processing

[Fake News Detector & Sentiment Analysis](/fake_news_detector.html)<br>
<br>
I used NLP techniques and trained a classification model to predict fake news articles. I've also performed sentiment analysis to determine news sentiment.<br>

### Machine Learning & Exploratory Data Analysis 

[Investment prediction](/investment_prediction.html)

Full end-to-end data science process was applied to predict investment outcomes using Russell 3000 Index financial data. I've performed exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, hypothesis testing, model selection and evaluation, feature selection and model optimisation.<br>

### Data Wrangling & Webscraping 

[Salary prediction](/part_3_predictive_modelling.html)<br>
<br>
I've extracted salary data from seek.com.au through web-scraping techniques and trained a classification model to predict data scientist salary.<br>

### Regression problem 

[Real estate prediction](pdf/regression.pdf)<br>
<br>
I've built regression model to predict real estate property prices. Identified top property features that will add the most value to property prices.<br>
